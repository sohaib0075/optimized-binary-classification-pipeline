# optimized-binary-classification-pipeline

This project implements an optimized machine learning pipeline for binary classification using multiple models (Random Forest, PyTorch, XGBoost, CatBoost). It explores performance improvements using parallel computing, GPU acceleration, and SMOTE-based class balancing. The codebase includes modular preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization for comparing accuracy, F1 score, and training time across different approaches.
